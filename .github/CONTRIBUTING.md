## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub][new-issue]. Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible* - Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific* - Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- *Unique* - Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- *Scoped to a Single Bug* - One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
