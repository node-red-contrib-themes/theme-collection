## Usage

Set `theme: "<theme-name>"` in the `editorTheme` object in your `settings.js` and then restart Node-RED.

For example, this sets Node-RED to use the `midnight-red` theme.

```js
editorTheme: {
    theme: "midnight-red"
},
```

For details on the Node-RED's configuration file and its structure, please refer to the [Node-RED official documentation][node-red-doc].

### Monaco Editor Theme

Each theme in this collection comes with a pre-configured theme for the Monaco editor.

Just leave `theme` in the `codeEditor` object commented out.

For example, this sets Node-RED to use the `dracula` theme and its pre-configured theme for the Monaco editor.

```js
editorTheme: {
    theme: "dracula",
    codeEditor: {
        lib: "monaco",
        options: {
            // theme: "",
        },
    },
},
```

### Mermaid Theme

Each theme in this collection comes with a pre-configured theme for the Mermaid diagramming and charting tool.

Just leave `theme` in the `mermaid` object commented out.

For example, this sets Node-RED to use the `dark` theme and its pre-configured theme for the Mermaid diagramming and charting tool.

```js
editorTheme: {
    theme: "dark",
    mermaid: {
        // theme: "",
    },
},
```
